what should i even send to scigraph ontology
pointers:
- case a: sending titles to ontology 
- case b:take 4/5 use cases from ddh program, find columns with specific noun, mine papers

1. come up with relevant terms to go in ontology
	- how to get the terms
		a. you already have a dictionary of terms to use
			i. the index
			ii. find the terms that are statistically relevant, corporus based statistical methods

		b. 
2. then worry about relationships


TODO: read c value paper, then read other paper, then dataset from coral reef, apply to that corpus

1. use part-of-speech tagging from nlp
2. filter for noun phrases, will get nested things like: the president of the united states
	a. throw away things from stop list, from adam
3. now we see what goes into ontology, we have repititions
	a. frequency of single string
	b. frequency of longer candidate terms
	c. number of these longer candidate terms
	d. length of candidate string

	eigenvector valuen


first 100, noun phrases
task 0 - turn abstract to text, throw away line with '@'
task 1 - core nlp, grab noun phrases
task 2 - take abstracts, find terms that are already known


keep adjectives
keep both inner and outer nounphrase
remove pronouns

keep nounphrases, nounphrases within nounphrases, do not extract anything, remove pronouns, keep duplicates
hashmap, word to frequency
print out
length and proposition penalties
compute weight based on second paper
ontology quality

Phone Number: 858-534-3693 
858-366-3393 text aside from time 3-5

Mean time: get about 20 abstract results and start making the ranks
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

take out articles and pronouns that are the first characters
punctuation, remove, keep within one phrase
rank them, have a threshhold, a sharp knee, keep a list of those above and below threshold
knee - the point between the small group and the big group, highest derivative, derivative = 0, change the sign, plot all the ranks, histogram of the ranks, in buckets

python - abstract cleaner, abstract splitter
java - pos tagger
python - hashmap stitching, ranking

capitalization? all capitalized or all lower cased <--camel

remove "Abstract"
add stop word list, remove 
stretch with sigmoid

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

X -	fix scaling
	reimplement with cfinder
X - throw out 2 letter
	fix words broken by line
X -	(stoplist) and (stoplist) -> throw away (first word stop list) (check if rest of phrase is in stoplist)
X -	length penalty of 4

- equivalence relations -> abbreviations
- create equivalence if none exists
- how to add new nodes to ontology with edges
- query scigraph for connections
Problems:
1. Equivalence relations where phrase1 = phrase2 (e.g. "water body" and "body of water"), list of equivalence pairs
2. Abbreviations (e.g. "USA" and "United States (of America)")
3. "Pacific Islands" and "Islands of the Pacific" -> take the common nouns and ignore propositions to find equivalence
4. "Ravine" === "Gorge" -> no idea

- What's the difference between cinergiExtensions.owl and cinergi.owl?
	- cinergi.owl for adding terms, synonyms, labels, descriptions, no cinergiParent, cinergiFacet
	- cinergiExtensions.owl for relationships
- What are the different types of annotations and when would you use which?
	- cinergiFacet: if a term is meant to appear on the result list of terms
	- cinergiParent: overrides keyword enhancing
		- node from existing ontology so we cant change parent, we use cinergiParent
- How to query CINERGI for relationships? through code?
	- owlAPI (https://sourceforge.net/projects/owlapi/files/OWL%20API%20%28for%20OWL%202.0%29/3.5.2/)
	- net.sourceforge.owlapi
	owlapi-parent
	3.5.2
- How to add relationships through code?
- How does Protege translate .owl to an ontology? Where to view?
	- Who deploys?
- Where is the code for determining relationshps? GitHub? What is the code there?

Tutorial: http://protege.stanford.edu/ontologies/pizza/pizza.owl
- iterate through pizza ontology, for every entity fragment of class, find all the entity fragment which have a combined name (ex. FourSeason, AmericanHot) to separate names (Ex. Four Season, American Hot)
- no label, add a label
- owl ontology walker -> have it do something as it walks the ontology
- in English
- File -> Save As... -> format OWL/XML

1. set up owlAPI

DONE

insert textrank union high rank from corenlp

1. graph api
2. figure out where to place it
	a. pre-questions
		- Is this term already there, overlapping?
			- substring, not necessarily perfect, n-gram, by character or word, min 2 max 5, break work into 2 characters, a set of substring, intersection/union, high if overlap, identical will be 1, jaccard coefficent, high overlap throughout ngrams, 
		- Where is the attachment point of term?
			new term -> ?
	b. post-questions
